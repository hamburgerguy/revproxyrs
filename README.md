# revproxyrs
reverse proxy address in rust, one possible implementation. 
only requires two dependencies and thats for generating the JSON files which aren't necessarry for the main inner workings of the code and have been commented out except for testing purposes.

to run simply run "cargo run" in terminal, can be swapped with different server addresses, just use necessary dependencies to output as JSON files.
